Description: The caroline R library contains dozens of functions useful
 for: database migration (dbWriteTable2), database style joins &
 aggregation (nerge, groupBy, & bestBy), data structure
 conversion (nv, tab2df), legend table making (sstable & leghead),
 automatic legend positioning for scatter and box plots (),  
 plot annotation (labsegs & mvlabs), data visualization 
 (pies, sparge, confound.grid & raPlot), character string manipulation (m & pad),
 file I/O (write.delim), batch scripting, data exploration, and more.
 The package's greatest contributions lie in the database style merge, 
 aggregation and interface functions as well as in it's extensive
 use and propagation of row, column and vector names in most functions.
