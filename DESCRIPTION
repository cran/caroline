Description: The caroline R library contains dozens of functions useful
    for: database migration (dbWriteTable2), database style joins &
    aggregation (nerge, groupBy & bestBy), data structure
    conversion (nv, tab2df), legend table making (sstable &
    leghead), plot annotation (labsegs & mvlabs), data
    visualization (violins, pies & raPlot), character string
    manipulation (m & pad), file I/O (write.delim), batch scripting
    and more.  The package's greatest contributions lie in the 
    database style merge, aggregation and interface functions 
    as well as in it's extensive use and propagation of 
    row, column and vector names in most functions.
